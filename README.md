Decision Tree Classification on Bank Marketing Data
----------------

This project involves the use of decision trees in R to examine a dataset containing bank marketing information.  The goal is to determine the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit.  I implemented techniques such as oversampling and random forests to see if they improve the accuracy of my model.

The full report can be found in the file "Decision Trees.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, data partition, predictive modeling, model results, model tuning, model comparison, and proposed solutions.  Tables, visualizations, and a copy of my code are included in the appendices.

The dataset "bank-marketing.csv" and the data description can be found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

The R script is included in the file "decision trees script.R".  The requirements are described in the file "requirements.txt".  Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file.  After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
